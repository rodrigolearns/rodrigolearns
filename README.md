Dear Reader,

On this page, I wish to showcase my skills and coding achievements.
I have a wide variety of interests, ranging from microscopy and image analysis to transcriptomic data analysis.
As I delve into the galaxy that is the coding corpus of knowledge, I hope to regularly update my repository collection.
I have worked as a research software engineer in Maastricht at M4I developing the OMERO server along with DataHub (repos still private).
Currently, my role is to develop a data management infrastructure for multiple CORE labs in Amsterdam UMC.

Bests,
  RRB
