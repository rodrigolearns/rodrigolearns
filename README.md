- Dear Reader, Iâ€™m Rodrigo Rosas Bertolini.
- In this page I wish to showcase my skills and coding achievements.
- I have a wide variety of interestes, ranging from microscopy and image analysis, to transcriptomic data analysis.
- As I delve into the galaxy that is the coding corpus of knowledge, I hope to regulary update my repository collection.
- My intention is to use coding for bioinformatics purpouses.
- However, it is likely to look pretty random; at least at first...
